# Claudito (Windows + Korean fork)

> **Fork notice**: This is a fork of [comfortablynumb/claudito](https://github.com/comfortablynumb/claudito) (MIT).
> See [CHANGES.md](./CHANGES.md) for the patches added in this fork.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## What this fork adds

- **Windows `.cmd` spawn fix** — Resolves `claude.cmd` via PATH and uses `shell: true` so the agent can actually launch on Windows (vs. `spawn EINVAL` / `ENOENT`).
- **Fixed credentials via `.env`** — `dotenv/config` preload on `npm start`, so `CLAUDITO_USERNAME` / `CLAUDITO_PASSWORD` / `PORT` are loaded from a project-local `.env` instead of auto-generated each restart.
- **Korean + English font stack** — `Consolas` / `Malgun Gothic` (Windows defaults) so Korean characters render correctly alongside Latin glyphs.

## Security Considerations

> **Important**: Claudito runs Claude Code agents that can execute code and modify files on your system. Take these precautions:

| Scenario | Recommended HOST | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Local development** | `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` | Only accessible from your machine (default) |
| **LAN access** | Your private IP (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) | Accessible from your local network |
| **All interfaces** | `0.0.0.0` | Accessible from anywhere - use with caution |

**Best Practices:**
1. **Use authentication**: Claudito requires login by default. Set custom credentials for production:
   ```bash
   CLAUDITO_USERNAME=myuser CLAUDITO_PASSWORD=mystrongpassword claudito
   ```
2. **Avoid exposing to the internet**: Use a reverse proxy with HTTPS if needed
3. **Configure firewall rules**: Only allow trusted IP addresses
4. **Review permission rules**: Configure Claude Code permissions to restrict agent capabilities

See [Security Recommendations](#security-recommendations) for more details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation required)
npx claudito

# Or install globally
npm install -g claudito
claudito
```

Open your browser at **http://localhost:3000** to access the web UI.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 20.0.0 or higher |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Latest version |

### Installing and Authenticating Claude Code CLI

Before using Claudito, you must have the Claude Code CLI installed and **logged in**. Claudito works with either:
- **Claude Pro/Max subscription** (recommended for personal use)
- **Anthropic API key** (for API-based usage)

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version

# Log in to Claude Code (required before using Claudito)
claude auth
```

> **Important:** Claudito requires an active Claude Code session. Make sure you can run `claude` directly in your terminal before starting Claudito.

For more details, see the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Installation

### Option 1: Run with npx (Recommended)

No installation required. Run directly:

```bash
npx claudito
```

This downloads and runs the latest version automatically.

### Option 2: Global Installation

Install once, run anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g claudito
claudito
```

### Option 3: Local Installation

For development or integration into a project:

```bash
npm install claudito
npx claudito
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start with defaults (localhost:3000)
claudito

# Specify a custom port
claudito --port 8080
claudito -p 8080

# Listen on all network interfaces
claudito --host 0.0.0.0

# Combine options
claudito -p 8080 --host 0.0.0.0
```

### CLI Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |

## Features

### Agent Modes

#### Interactive Mode (Default)
Chat with Claude in real-time. The agent auto-starts when you send your first message.

- Real-time streaming of Claude's responses
- See tool usage as it happens (file reads, edits, bash commands)
- Code diffs with syntax highlighting and inline change highlighting
- Send follow-up messages naturally
- Toggle permission mode (Plan/Accept Edits) at runtime
- Plan mode with approve/reject/request changes options
- **Plan Mode Auto-Continue**: When Claude calls `EnterPlanMode`, the agent automatically restarts in plan mode and sends "Continue" so work proceeds without manual intervention
- Per-project model selection (Claude Sonnet 4/Opus 4/Opus 4.5/Haiku)

#### Ralph Loop Mode (Advanced)
Implements Geoffrey Huntley's "Ralph Wiggum technique" - an iterative worker/reviewer pattern for complex tasks:

- **Worker Phase**: Fresh Claude instance executes the task
- **Reviewer Phase**: Another Claude instance reviews the work and provides structured feedback
- **Iteration**: Worker addresses feedback, reviewer re-evaluates
- **Completion**: Reviewer approves work, max iterations reached, or critical failure
- **Configuration**: Set max iterations, worker/reviewer models, custom prompts
- **Real-time Progress**: Live streaming output from both worker and reviewer
- **History**: View past Ralph Loop executions

Access via the Ralph Loop tab when an agent is running.


### Project Management

- **Add Projects**: Point to any directory with a codebase
- **Import from GitHub**: Browse and search your GitHub repos, clone directly into Claudito as a project
- **GitHub Issues**: Browse project issues with filters, create new issues (with labels, assignees, milestones), "Start Working" sends issue as agent prompt, "Add to Roadmap" creates a task, close issues and add comments
- **GitHub PRs**: Create PRs with auto-generated title/description from conversation history and diff, browse PRs with state filters, view PR detail with reviews and comments, "Fix PR Feedback" sends review feedback as agent prompt
- **Multi-Project Support**: Manage multiple projects simultaneously
- **Concurrent Execution**: Run multiple agents at once (configurable limit)
- **Queue System**: Automatic queuing when at max capacity

### Authentication

Claudito includes built-in authentication to protect your agent manager:

- **Auto-generated credentials**: On each server start, a unique username and password are generated
- **QR Code login**: Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal for quick access
- **Session persistence**: Sessions last 7 days
- **Custom credentials**: Set `CLAUDITO_USERNAME` and `CLAUDITO_PASSWORD` environment variables for persistent credentials
- **Logout**: Click the logout button in the sidebar header

Configure the output folder in Settings > General > Inventify Folder.

### Slack Integration

Connect Claudito to your Slack workspace to receive agent notifications and send commands from Slack:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agent Notifications** | Block Kit messages on agent completed, failed, waiting for input, Ralph Loop events |
| **Per-Project Config** | Configure notification channel, event types, @mention users, thread replies |
| **Thread-Based Updates** | First notification starts a thread; subsequent events for the same project reply in-thread |
| **Channel Feeds** | Link a Slack channel to a project for automatic conversation summaries on completion |
| **Slash Commands** | `/claudito status`, `/claudito start <project> <prompt>`, `/claudito stop <project>`, `/claudito link`, `/claudito unlink` |
| **Interactive Buttons** | Stop Agent, Approve Plan, Reject Plan actions directly from Slack notifications |

**Setup**:
1. Create a Slack App with Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `groups:history`, `groups:read`
2. Enable Socket Mode and add App Token Scope: `connections:write`
3. Enable **Event Subscriptions** and under *Subscribe to bot events* add: `message.channels`, `message.groups`
4. Add the `/claudito` slash command pointing to your Socket Mode app
5. In Claudito Settings → Integrations → Slack: enter Bot Token and App Token
6. **Invite the bot to every channel** you want to link: `/invite @<botname>`

## Configuration

### Global Settings

Access settings via the gear icon in the UI sidebar.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `maxConcurrentAgents` | Maximum simultaneous agents (1-10) | `3` |
| `sendWithCtrlEnter` | Ctrl+Enter sends (true) or Enter sends (false) | `true` |
| `historyLimit` | Max conversations in history | `25` |
| `agentPromptTemplate` | Template for agent instructions | (see below) |
| `defaultModel` | Default Claude model for agents | `claude-opus-4-6` |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | Custom text appended to Claude's system prompt | `""` |
| `inventifyFolder` | Parent directory where Inventify creates new projects | `""` |

### Permission Configuration

Control what Claude agents can do without prompting. Access via Settings > Claude Code Permissions.

> **⚠️ Important Limitation**: Claudito currently only supports **Accept Edits** and **Plan** permission modes. The **Default** mode (which prompts for permission on each action) is not yet supported because Claudito cannot currently handle Claude's permission prompts. We're working on adding this functionality in a future release.

#### Permission Modes

| Mode | Description | Supported |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `acceptEdits` | Auto-approve file edits | ✅ Yes |
| `plan` | Review plan before execution | ✅ Yes |
| `default` | Ask for each action | ❌ Not yet |

#### Permission Rules

Rules follow the format: `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)`

**Examples:**
- `Read` - Allow all file reads
- `Bash(npm run:*)` - Allow npm run commands
- `Bash(git status)` - Allow specific command
- `Read(./.env)` - Deny reading .env files (use in deny rules)

#### Allow Rules (auto-approve)
Tools that execute without prompting:
```
Read
Glob
Grep
Bash(npm run:*)
Bash(git status)
Bash(git diff:*)
```

#### Deny Rules (block)
Tools that are blocked entirely (take priority over allow rules):
```
Read(./.env)
Read(./.env.*)
Bash(rm -rf:*)
Bash(curl:*)
```

#### Quick Presets

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Safe Development | Common dev tools, blocks dangerous commands |
| Git Only | Read access + git commands |
| Read Only | File reading only, no writes or commands |
| Clear All | Remove all rules |

#### Skip All Permissions (Legacy)

The "Skip ALL permission prompts" toggle uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` which bypasses all checks. This is not recommended for production use.

#### Per-Project Overrides

Each project can have its own permission overrides that extend the global rules. Access via the project's settings menu.

### Prompt Templates

Create reusable message templates with dynamic fields. Access via Settings > Templates.

**Variable syntax**: `${type:name}` or `${type:name:options}`

- `${text:varname}` - Single-line text input
- `${textarea:varname}` - Multi-line textarea
- `${select:varname:opt1,opt2,opt3}` - Dropdown select
- `${checkbox:varname}` - Boolean checkbox

**Usage**: Click template button near input → select template → fill variables → insert

**Default templates**: Code Review, Bug Fix Request, Feature Implementation, Refactoring Request, Documentation Request

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

Configure MCP servers to extend Claude's capabilities. Access via Settings > MCP Servers.

**MCP Server Configuration**:
- **Name**: Display name for the server
- **Type**: `stdio` (local command) or `http` (remote API)
- **Command/URL**: Server executable or API endpoint
- **Arguments**: Command-line arguments (stdio only)
- **Environment**: Environment variables
- **Enabled**: Toggle server on/off

**Example stdio server**:
```json
{
  "name": "GitHub MCP",
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token" }
}
```

### Chrome Browser

Toggle Chrome browser usage for Claude agents via the **Chrome** button in the conversation toolbar (next to MCP Servers). When enabled, passes `--chrome` to Claude CLI; when disabled, passes `--no-chrome`. The setting is saved globally and applies to all new agent sessions (interactive, one-off, and autonomous).

### Danger Zone (Factory Reset)

Access via Settings > Danger Zone. The "Wipe All Data" button permanently deletes:
- All project registrations and per-project `.claudito/` directories
- All conversation history
- Global settings, PID tracking, and project index (`~/.claudito/`)
- Temporary MCP config files (`{OS_TEMP}/claudito-mcp/`)

Project source files are **never** deleted.

### Agent Prompt Template

Customize how instructions are given to agents. Available variables:

- `${var:project-name}` - Project name
- `${var:phase-title}` - Current phase from ROADMAP.md
- `${var:milestone-title}` - Current milestone title
- `${var:milestone-item}` - Specific task to work on

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your home directory:

```
~/.claudito/
├── projects/
│   └── index.json          # Project registry
├── settings.json           # Global settings
└── pids.json              # Active process tracking

## Testing the Package Locally

Before publishing, you can test the package locally to verify everything works correctly.

### Method 1: npm pack (Recommended)

Create a tarball and install it:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Create the package tarball
npm pack

# This creates claudito-0.1.0.tgz (version may vary)

# Install globally from the tarball
npm install -g ./claudito-0.1.0.tgz

# Test the CLI
claudito --help
claudito --version
claudito  # Starts the server

# Uninstall when done
npm uninstall -g claudito
```

### Method 2: npm link

Create a symlink for development:

```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Create global symlink
npm link

# Now 'claudito' command is available globally
claudito --help
claudito

# Unlink when done
npm unlink -g claudito
```

### Method 3: Dry Run

Preview what would be published without creating a file:

```bash
# See what files would be included
npm pack --dry-run

# Check package size and contents
npm publish --dry-run
```

### Method 4: Local npx

Test as if running with npx:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the CLI directly
node dist/cli.js --help
node dist/cli.js

# Or use npm script
npm run cli -- --help
npm run cli -- --port 8080
```

### Verifying the Package Contents

Check that the package includes everything needed:

```bash
# List all files that will be published
npm pack --dry-run 2>&1 | grep "npm notice"

# Expected contents:
# - dist/          (compiled JavaScript)
# - public/        (frontend assets)
# - README.md
# - LICENSE
# - package.json
```

### Testing in a Clean Environment

For thorough testing, install in an isolated directory:

```bash
# Create test directory
mkdir /tmp/claudito-test
cd /tmp/claudito-test

# Install from tarball
npm init -y
npm install /path/to/claudito-0.1.0.tgz

# Run via npx
npx claudito --help

# Clean up
cd ..
rm -rf /tmp/claudito-test
```

## Security Recommendations

### Network Binding

By default, Claudito binds to `localhost` which only accepts connections from the local machine. When exposing Claudito to other devices, consider these recommendations:

| Scenario | Recommended HOST | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Local development** | `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` | Only accessible from your machine |
| **LAN access** | Your private IP (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) | Accessible from your local network |
| **All interfaces** | `0.0.0.0` | Accessible from anywhere - use with caution |

```bash
# Local only (most secure)
claudito --host 127.0.0.1

# Specific network interface (LAN access)
claudito --host 192.168.1.100

# All interfaces (least secure - requires authentication)
claudito --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use authentication**: Claudito requires login by default. Set custom credentials via environment variables for production use:
   ```bash
   CLAUDITO_USERNAME=myuser CLAUDITO_PASSWORD=mystrongpassword claudito
   ```

2. **Avoid exposing to the internet**: Claudito is designed for local/LAN use. If you must expose it, use a reverse proxy with HTTPS.

3. **Firewall rules**: When using LAN access, configure your firewall to only allow trusted IP addresses.

4. **Review permission rules**: Configure Claude Code permission rules to restrict what agents can do.

## Troubleshooting

### "claude: command not found"

The Claude Code CLI is not installed or not in your PATH:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Port already in use

Another process is using port 3000:

```bash
# Use a different port
claudito --port 3001

# Or find and kill the process using port 3000
# Linux/macOS:
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>

# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Agent not responding

Check the Debug panel (gear icon > Debug) to view:
- Process status and PID
- Recent logs
- Last executed command

### Mermaid diagrams not rendering

Ensure that:
1. You're using the `mermaid` language identifier in code blocks
2. The diagram syntax is valid (check browser console for errors)
3. Try refreshing the page if diagrams appear as "[object Object]"

### Ralph Loop not working

Verify that:
1. An agent is running for the project
2. You've provided a clear task description
3. Worker and reviewer models are selected
4. Check the Ralph Loop output for specific errors

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
